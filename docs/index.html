            <p class="pb-2">Hey founders—</p>
            <p class="pb-2">I'm Simon, founder of ATWU Capital, and I've been in your shoes.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">Building a tech company from scratch is incredibly hard. You're juggling product development, customer validation, and a million other things while trying to keep your runway alive. And traditional investors? They often take weeks just to respond to your email.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">That's exactly why I created ATWU Capital. We believe the earliest stage of building a company shouldn't be about perfect metrics or polished pitch decks. It should be about passionate people with the technical skills and determination to solve real problems.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">When I was building my first startup, I wished for an investor who could make quick decisions, actually understand the technical challenges, and be there when I needed advice – not just during board meetings.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">So that's what we built. We provide quick angel checks, review every deck within 24 hours (yes, really), and bring hands-on technical expertise to help you navigate the early challenges of building a tech company.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">Our team consists of founders and technical experts who've been there, built that. We're not just writing checks – we're backing people we believe in with the resources and support they need to succeed.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">If you're a tech founder in Europe with a bold vision and the skills to execute it, we want to hear from you. Send us your deck, and let's start this journey together.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">Building something remarkable starts with one step.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">Cheers,<br>
            Simon ✌️</p>
